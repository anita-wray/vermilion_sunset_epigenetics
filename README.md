# Vermilion Sunset Epigenetic Project

## Objective:
We attempted to improve estimates of age for both vermilion and sunset rockfish. Specifically, we 
1. Used the previously published genome of vermilion rockfish to identify the location of informative methylation markers used in European Bass, Australian lungfish, zebrafish, Murray cod, and Mary River cod (Anastasiadi & Piferrer, 2019, Mayne et al. 2021,  Mayne et al. 2022).
2. Developed primers to target those specific regions of the genome
3. Follow protocols outlined in Mayne et al. 2021,  Mayne et al. 2022, and Anastasiadi & Piferrer, 2019 to extract, bisulfite treat the DNA and amplify, barcode and sequence specific regions in the genome. Briefly, candidate epigenetic age markers will be multiplexed, and each sample barcoded for individual identification, and sequenced to obtain the methylation profiles at these candidate loci.



, Anastasiadi & Piferrer, 2019). By establishing specific genomic sites within teleost species, implementing this project for this species complex is much faster. In addition, this work will provide information necessary for proposed research on estimating population size using Close Kin Mark Recapture, and provide a baseline for this method to be implemented on other commercially and recreationally important species.
